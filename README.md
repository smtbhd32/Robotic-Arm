# 6-DoF Robotic Arm with ESP32 and Mobile App Control
This project is a robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) controlled wirelessly via a custom mobile application built using MIT App Inventor. It allows users to control the arm's movement in real-time using a smartphone or tablet.

## Hardware:
ESP32 microcontroller,
Servo motor,
Bluetooth module,
Various mechanical components for building the arm structure

## Software:
Arduino IDE (or similar) for ESP32 programming,
MIT App Inventor for mobile application development

# Getting Started
## Hardware Assembly:
Follow the instructions (link to instructions) to assemble the mechanical structure of the robotic arm.
Connect the servo motors and any additional electronics to the ESP32 board according to the schematic diagram (link to schematic).

## Software Setup:

## Install the Arduino IDE (or similar) on your computer.
Install any necessary libraries for ESP32 and Bluetooth communication (refer to library documentation for installation instructions).
Download the source code for the ESP32 program (link to code).
Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

## Mobile Application:

Download the MIT App Inventor software or access it online.
Download the source code for the mobile application (link to code).
Follow the instructions (link to instructions) to build and deploy the mobile application on your Android device.

# Usage
Turn on the ESP32 board and connect to it via Bluetooth using your mobile device.
Open the mobile application and you should be able to control the robotic arm's movement in real-time.
